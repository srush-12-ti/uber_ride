#  Uber Ride Cancellation — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on Uber ride cancellation data.

---

##  **Project Overview**

**Objective:**  
To understand the factors behind **ride cancellations** in Uber’s system by analyzing data related to trip distance, time, traffic conditions, pickup/drop locations, cancellation reasons, and more.

Key questions explored:
- What are the main reasons rides get canceled?
- Are there peak times or days with higher cancellation rates?
- How do distance, time of day, or location affect cancellations?
- Can we identify patterns that help Uber reduce cancellations and improve service reliability?

- `Uber ride cancellation.ipynb` — The complete EDA notebook.
- `requirements.txt` — Required Python libraries.
- `.gitignore` — Files/folders excluded from version control.
